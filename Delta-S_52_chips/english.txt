Several ZX Spectrum 48 or ZX Spectrum 128 compatible computers were produced 
under the name "Delta S". That computers differed in cases, keyboards,
support for the russian language, speed, compatibility and memory capacity.
My model is popularly called "Delta C 52 chips". This is a "ZX Spectrum 48"
compatible computer.

This Delta is the most beautiful ZX Spectrum compatible computer from the USSR.
It looks complete. It has the best keyboard among all Soviet spectrums. Its 
keyboard has become the standard for the rest of computers. With my point of
view, even the original ZX Spectrum is worse than the Delta.

An external floppy drive controller was produced for the Delta S. It connects 
to the side extension connector.
