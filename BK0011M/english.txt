BK0011M is a version of the BK0011 computer with repaired sound. Programs for
BK0010 running on BK0011 were executed without sound.

I will not dare to say for all BK0011M, but all computers that I have seen have
a good keyboard. Keyboard similar in design to MC7007 (UKNC) or Delta S.

No new features have emerged. This is the last computer in the BK series.
