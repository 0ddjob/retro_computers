The memory module contains the same memory chips as the computer itself.
The memory module contains 5x A573RU10 chips (analog 6216) with a total 
capacity of 10 kilobytes. This is static memory. It needs electricity to 
store data. Therefore, a battery is installed in the memory module. Batteries 
last for half a year. The large chip in the memory module is the controller 
that communicates with computer over a serial data bus, much like I2C. 
Chipselect, clock, data lines.
