Bashkiria-2M was developed at the Bashkir Research and Production Association
named of S. M. Kirov, in the Republic of Bashkiria, from which the computer got
its name. The computer is rare and there are very few native programs for it,
but the CP/M operating system partially compensates for this. This computer
solves two major problems for running CP/M programms. Programs do not have
enough RAM and the screen scrolls up for a long time. The computer has 128 KB of
RAM, and the video has vertical hardware scrolling. It allows you to use CP/M to
the maximum.

"To the maximum" with the proviso that the screen resolution would be a little
more. The screen resolution of Bashkiria 2M is 384x256 pixels. This is the
optimal resolution for color TVs or monitors of the time. The graininess and
focusing of televisions (CRT) allows you to see individual pixels. In addition,
the proportions of a pixel at this resolution are close to a square. But working
in CP/M, that is, working with text at 512 or 640 pixels, is more convenient.
In these modes, you can draw 80 characters per line in a clear font.

The computer can display 4 colors from a palette of 64 colors. The computer has
a built-in LAN adapter and a printer port.

The computer was produced in two versions: student and teacher. The student
computer came with an external ROM cartridge. Usually the BASIC programming
language was stored there. The teacher's computer was supplied with an external
floppy drive controller. It is impossible to connect the floppy drive controller
to the student's computer, since not all the necessary signals were output to
the student's computer expansion connector.
