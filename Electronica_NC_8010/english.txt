Electronica NC-8010 is a prototype of the BK0010 computer. A computer 
Electronica NC-8010 was produced in only a few copies. You can look at this
computer in the museums of Angstrem or Sitronics.

Until ~1980, NII TT processors and microcontrollers had their own command set. 
Probably the computer "Electronica NT-8010" uses a microcontroller K1801VE1 as
a central processor. The K1801VE1 microcontroller has a command set ENC-80T.
The microcontroller has 2 kilobytes ROM and 256 bytes RAM. It is interesting
that microcontroller has a 16 bit multiplication command.

After ~1980, the "Research Institute of Precision Technologies" switched to
the PDP-11 command set. Ordered or on their own initiative, this history is
silent. They redid 16 bit microcontroller K1801VE1 with the ENC-80T command set
to 16 bit microprocessor K1801VM1 with PDP-11 command set. They removed ROM and
RAM. But in the K1801VM1 microprocessor left programmable timer, similar in
function to timers of any microcontroller. For example, it can count the
pulses coming to the processor pin.

The BK0010 computer uses the new K1801VM1 microprocessor.
