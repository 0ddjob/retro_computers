Computer "Agat 9" is a Soviet school computer. It is partially compatible with
the "Apple II+" computer. The Agat 9 computer is not a copy of the Apple II+
computer. Agat was created as an independent computer, if possible, compatible
with Apple.

The main feature of this computer is that it was supplied to Soviet schools
with color monitors, disk drives in each computer, foreign games and programs.
Included with my Agat was an inkjet printer "Electronics MS6312".

My computer has 128 kilobytes of RAM installed, which was not bad for 1988.
Computer "Agat 9" can display graphics: 512x256 b/w, 280x192 b/w, 256x256 4
colors, 128x128 16 colors; or text 64x32 b/w, 40x24 b/w, 32x32 8 colors.

There are two significantly different generations of Agate. The first generation
is Agate 4, 7, 8. Computer "Agat 4" was released in 1984 in the amount of about
100 pieces. Computers "Agat 7" and "Agat 8" were released in 1985. For the user,
there are no significant differences between these models. If you want to dig
deeper, Wikipedia has a lot to say about Agate. The second generation is the
Agat 9 computer. It was released in 1988. But what about the other numbers?
Agate 1, 2, 3 these names were given to intermediate models that were shown to
magazines and high authorities. Models 5, 6 remained on paper.

The Agat keyboard can be inserted into the front panel of the case. These
stylish but poor quality keyboards were eventually replaced by the boring
MC7004 keyboards. In the MC7004 keyboards, the microcontroller firmware was
changed for the Agat computer. Agat keyboards are connected to the computer via
a serial interface. And without the keyboard, Agate does not turn on.

Agat has a processor compatible with MOS6502. Such a processor was used in the
Apple II+ computer, the Commodore 64 computer and the NES game console. Apart
from Agat, no other Soviet home or school computer used such a processor. 
A redesigned "Apple DOS" was used as the operating system. 140 KB drives
compatible with Apple and/or 840 KB drives compatible only with Agat were used.
It is impossible to read or write floppy disks for Agatha on IBM PC.
