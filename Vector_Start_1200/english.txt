Krista 2 is a Soviet home computer. This computer is partially compatible with
the Vector 06C computer. Unlike the Vector 06C computer, the Krista 2 computer
does not have a palette, 16 colors are fixed, the processor speed is lower, the
tape recording format is different. Krista has very few own programs.

The main reason for incompatibility with the "Vector 06C" computer is that the 
I/O port address for setting the palette in the "Vector 06C" computer is the
same as the RAM/ROM selection address in the "Vector Start" computer. The
program for the computer "Vector 06C" launched on the "Vector Start" disconnects
itself from the address space instead of setting the palette.

How to load BASIC programs? You need to load BASIC-1200. Type the MLOAD. Without
quotes and the program name. While loading on the border must run colored
stripes.

To start the game "Udavchik" you need to make #5000 in the monitor before
loading BASIC-1200. That sets the BASIC buffer boundary to 5000h, by default it
is 4500h. Run the "Udavchik" from the ROM flashed BASIC-1200 is not succeed.
