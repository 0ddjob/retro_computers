Apogee BK01C is a Soviet home computer, an improved version computer Radio 86RK.
In Apogee the RAM was increased to 52 kB. Added three-channel sound generator
(i8253 chip). Added an alternative character generator with character size of 
6x4 pixels, which allows you to display pseudographic resolution 192x102. Or 
384x204 with skillful use of character generator.

There are two versions of the computer: Apogey BK01 and Apogey BK01C. Apogey
BK01C has 8 colors. The screen displays colored characters on a black
background, or black symbols on a colored background. In pseudographic mode,
this means two colors into a matrix of 3x2 dots, one of which is black. Apogee
BK01 is a black and white. It can increase brightness of the background 
and the symbol at the same time. On the screen 4 colors can be displayed: 
black (background), dark gray (bright background), light gray (symbol), 
white (bright symbol).

The i8275 chip, on which the Radio 86RK video adapter is built, supported output
of a color image, but for the sake of simplicity of the Radio 86RK scheme, it
contains a color output did not do. Color output was done in Apogey BK01C. Color
management in i8275 for the programmer was implemented extremely inconveniently.
The programmer wrote into video memory a special value with codes 80h - 9Fh,
which changed the color of all characters following it. These characters could
be displayed as spaces, but then there were unused positions on the screen. Or
the video controller could work without spaces, but this would shift the entire
video memory by one character. The address symbol in video memory with certain
coordinates depended on the previous characters and in general could be anything.
Well, no more than 16 color changes were allowed per line. And also the
desynchronization of the DMA controller and video adapter, which led to
twitching and shifting of the screen.
