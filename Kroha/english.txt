"Kroha" is a computer with a joystick instead of a keyboard. Programs for this
computer are stored in removable ROM.

The circuit of this computer is similar to the "Specialist" computer. The main
difference from the computer "Specialist" is that in "Kroha" is implemented a
text video adapter, not a graphic one. Screen size 48x32 characters. All
characters are black and white. The character generator contains 256 characters.
The ROM of the character generator is installed on a replaceable PCB, a
cartridge. The use of two removable ROMs, for the program and for graphics
(characters), is very similar to the Nintendo Entertainment System.

Only one cartridge was produced for this computer. It contained games: Wall,
Tetris, Caterpillar, Balls, Air Defense.

In Kroha, the video frame sync is connected to a processor interrupt. A static
memory is used, the information in which is stored after the power is turned off
thanks to a galvanic cell. There are only 2048 bytes of RAM, of which 1536 bytes
are used by video, and only 512 bytes remain for the programmer.

From the author of the computer, Caro:

There was a period in my life when I worked at SKB Kontur. That's when I
developed this set-up box "Kroha". We then sat on the territory of the
Technosvyaz plant, which was supposed to assemble these devices for conversion
(law of transition to a market economy). We made about 200 pieces. It did not
get into the stores. It went to the workers of the plant and the SKB Kontur.
The main problem of course - the lack of games.

The photos were sent to me by Dmitry [Newbilius] Moiseev. I don't have this
computer.
