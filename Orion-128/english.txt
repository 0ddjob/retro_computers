"Orion 128" is a simple Soviet computer for self-assembly. Circuit of this 
computer was published in 1990 in the magazine "Radio".

The reader needed to make or find a PCB himself, find parts, find the keyboard,
then solder everything together, flash the ROM, and after that find and fix 
everything malfunctions. The main purpose of this computer is to explain how
computers works. But some factories produced "Orion 128" assembled. For example,
this one.

The PCB of this computer is slightly different from the magazine version.
Changed place to connect the keyboard. Among the photos: the green board from
the magazine, the yellow board has been modified at the factory.

From my personal point of view, "Orion 128" is an improved version of the
computer "Specialist". Their schemes are very similar, only Orion 128 has 2-4
times more RAM, 128 or 256 kilobytes. More color graphics, 16 colors.
And the processor is a bit faster.

Since it was a DIY computer, it was easy to upgrade. Users was installing the
Z80 processor. Users was increasing the clock frequency processor from 2.5 MHz
to 7 MHz. In this case, Orion 128 was the fastest 8 bit computer. Users
was installing a sound synthesizer chip AY8910. Users was connecting the floppy
drive controller.

Below, I write about the standard magazine version of the computer. Let me
clarify, because that a DIY computer can be remade in any way. Orion 128
computer loading operating system from an external ROM (cartridge), which
is connected to the socket on the back of the computer.

In addition to the operating system, this external ROM can contain any files.
Immediately after turning on, the monitor screen displays blue bars with
a list of files, like Norton Commander. Files written to external ROM this
device A:. Devices B:, C:, D: are files in RAM (RAM disk).

When the power is turned off, all user-written files are lost. Whatever lose
data, before turning off the power, the user must make a backup a copy of the
files to a tape recorder.
