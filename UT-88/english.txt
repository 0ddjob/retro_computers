"UT-88" is a self-assembly computer. In the 80s in the USSR in some magazines
published a circuits of computers for self-assembly. These were very simple
computers. First of all, they were not intended for playing or work, but
for teaching digital circuitry.

and Circuits description of the computer "UT-88" were published in 1989 in the
magazine "UT for skillful hands" ("Lefty", supplement to the magazine "Young
Technician", 1989, No. 2-8). And later in several more books. Based on one of
these books, I built this computer.
