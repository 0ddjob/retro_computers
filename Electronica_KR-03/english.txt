Electronica KR-03 is a Radio 86RK with 16 kilobytes of RAM in a good metal case
with a reliable power supply and an excellent keyboard.

There is only 16 kilobytes of RAM here, usually 32 kilobytes are installed in
Radio 86RK. RAM can be increased by soldering memory chips on the second floor.
It's a pity to lose the warranty? It have no warranty in anycase. The box of the
computer says "Radioconstructor" only so that the seller would have a legal way
not to give a guarantee for the computer. The computer was sold assembled and
ready to go.

MS7007 keyboard is used here. This is one of the best keyboards in the USSR.
She is reliable and pleasant. But, this keyboard is not compatible with Radio
86RK. In almost all games, the labels on the buttons will not correspond to
reality. For the game man is moving to the right, you must press not the right
arrow, but some kind of symbol. If the program works with the keyboard through
the BIOS functions, then everything is fine. Only most games work directly with
the hardware, which is why such problems arise. But these are trifles. No normal
games for Radio 86RK is avialable, but typing on this keyboard is a pleasure.
