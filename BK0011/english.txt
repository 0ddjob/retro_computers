BK0011 is a continuation of the development of the computer BK0010.01. CPU 
frequency has been increased from 3 MHz to 4 MHz. RAM has been increased from
32 kB up to 128 kB. Previously, only 16 kB was available to the user, the rest
was occupied by video memory, and now 112 kB is available. The difference is 7
times! Used paging memory, because address space of the K1801VM1 processor only
64 kB.

An external floppy drive controller was supplied with the BK0011 computer. But
this only applies to home versions. Only one controller was included to schools
complect of 13 computers.

To run some programs for BK0010 on BK0011, you must first load the BK0010 ROM
image into RAM. Entry points and set of routines in the ROM of BK0011 has
changed significantly. Also in programs for BK0010 launched there will be no
sound on BK0011 due to an error in the computer circuit.

Page management added to unused control bits port of sound port. And so that
old programs do not accidentally switch the memory page, working with sound, the
authors of the computer blocked this port entirely for old programs. In the
BK0011M computer, next version of BK0011, the sound was returned. There are
blocked only the page memory control bits.

Everyone was waiting for a new video mode, everyone wanted 8 or 16 colors.
256x256 4 colors for 1989 year is not serious. But no, the graphics mode has not
changed. Appeared the ability to select one of two video pages to be displayed
on the monitor. And appeared a palette, or rather 16 alternative sets of colors.

Take a look at palettes 5, 6, 7, 8. They contain identical colors. What for?
Palettes 9, 10 are the same. What for? And you will not find a palette in which
there would be blue and white colors. And this combination first comes to mind
when you are going to write Norton commander. I can't think of a reason why they
put together such a palette. Even if for the authors it is absolutely did not
care.. Even if they choose colors by random way, by throwing the die, the result
will be better. Unless, they mixed up at the factory firmware. We flashed the
ROM of the palettes with firmware for the microprocessor. May be...
