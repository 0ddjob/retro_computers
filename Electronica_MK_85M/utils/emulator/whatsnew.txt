version 48, 2018/01/22

- disassembler (relative address mode)


version 47, 2016/08/21

- changed appearance (bigger image)


version 46, 2010/12/17

- debugger code cleanup in order to make it more portable
- debugger invoked with the key F3 instead of F10, because F10 appears to be
  by default reserved for the system to switch between windows
- all file names converted to lower case


version 45, 2009/12/25

Changes and fixes of the CPU instruction set in order to conform to the test
programs 791401, 791402, 691404:
- the Stack Pointer register can take odd values
- the instruction SXT clears the V flag
- the instruction MFPS sets the flags as the instruction MOVB
- the instructions ASH and ASHC treat the shifted value as signed
- the instructions MUL and DIV set the V flag if the product or quotient
  is outside the range -32768..+32767
- the instructions JMP and JSR with a register as the destination cause
  TRAP 04h instead of TRAP 08h


version 43, 2009/09/23

- selectable data size (byte/word) in the binary editor


version 42, 2009/08/10

- selectable base of the numeral system used by the debugger


version 41, 2008/02/14

- code cleanup
- added RAM initialisation key (F8)


version 40, 2007/12/23

- fixed a cosmetic issue (a released key wasn't redrawn when the main
  form lost focus)
- increased the limit of the RAM size to 32kbytes (the system supports
  only 30kB though)


version 39, 2007/10/24

- fixed bug with the overflow flag calculation in the instructions ADD,
  SUB, CMP, CMPB


version 38, 2007/07/12

- the ROM size was increased to 32kB
- fixed key locks occurring when the main form loses the focus while
  a key is being pressed


version 37, 2007/03/22

- optimised CPU emulation (removed superfluous address calculations)
- fixed instruction DEC which incorrectly set the V flag
- fixed a bug causing the program to crash when the emulated CPU was
  ordered from the Debug Window to execute small count of instructions


version 36, 2007/03/15

- code cleanup in order to make it more reusable
- fixed interrupt vectors in the HALT mode


version 33, 2006/11/3

- the window dragging uses fully documented approach (earlier version
  used an undocumented system message)
- unified palette for all images fixed some display quirks (random
  hue changes)
- improved animation of key movements
- changed the font charset to DEFAULT which fixed the Debug form
  appearance on localised Windows versions


version 32, 2006/10/11

- faster application launch and termination due to optimised choice
  of the file transfer routines
- changed the way the application windows is dragged


version 31, 2006/06/06

- debugger code cleanup
- disabled the Tab key in the Debug form (in previous versions it
  moved the focus to the next control which disturbed the editing)


version 30, 2006/04/09

- the image on the screen is redrawn only when its contents has
  changed, reduces mouse cursor flickers visible on some old computers


version 29, 2006/03/19

- added support for the complete HALT mode instruction set
- added support for the floating point instruction set extension
- fixed a bug in the assembler/disassembler concerning instructions
  ADD and SUB


version 28, 2006/03/05

- added support for bit 11 of the CPU control register $104 (optional
  clock divide by 8) which results in more accurate timing
- added support for the HALT operating mode, instructions HALT, RTI,
  RTT corrected accordingly
- corrected emulation of the STOP key, the supposed interrupt proved
  to be a switch to the HALT-mode
- the supposed undocumented Return From Interrupt instruction (code
  00012, temporarily named RTI12) proved to be a HALT-mode instruction
  GO causing return to the USER-mode


version 27, 2006/02/21

- fixed a bug which caused the initial "READY P0" message sometimes to
  appear distorted


version 26, 2006/02/14

- added support for instructions MARK, ASH, ASHC
- instruction RTI12 added to the assembler and disassembler
- fixed a bug in the assembler which caused problems with instructions
  ASHC and BHIS


version 25, 2006/02/12

- the address is always aligned to be even for word size access
- corrected emulation of interrupts (they don't use the stack any more),
  instructions HALT and RTI12 modified accordingly


version 24, 2006/02/08

- corrected TRAP emulation
- added support for the T status bit
- added support for instructions MFPS, MTPS, WAIT, HALT


version 22, 2006/02/03

- added assembler
