Electronica MS5316 Floppy drive (Электроника МС5316 НГМД)

Year:	≤1992

"Electronica MS5316" is a case with a power supply and a floppy drive. Inside
the case different Soviet drives could be installed: MS5305, MS5311, MS5313 and
even foreign drives. For example, I have a japanese drive "MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC 
U288Y073". The lever is in the wrong place. Part of the case front panel is cut
out. Eyewitnesses said to me that it was in this form that it was sold.

Some Soviet home computers could connect an external floppy drive. Floppy drive
in the 80s was a dream. Drive with controller the drive sometimes cost more
than the computer itself. User could buy a floppy drive without a case and
just put it on the table near the computer. And use it without a case.
Or user could buy such a nice external floppy drive.
