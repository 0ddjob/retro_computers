Assistant 86 128 is an IBM PC-compatible Soviet home computer. All computer
PCBs are in a single case with a keyboard. Assistant 128 is the coolest and
largest computer in this form factor in the USSR.

Inside the computer, one above the other, there are 5 PCBs: a keyboard board,
a video adapter board and 128 kilobytes of RAM, a central processor board, a
ROM board, a drive controller board and 1 megabyte of RAM. Inside the computer
case is still a switching power supply.

Assistant 86 128 computer has a i8086 processor operating at a frequency of
4.7 MHz. This is a faster processor than was found in the original IBM PC.
i8088 was used there. i8086 has an external data bus of 16 bits, while i8088
has only 8 bits, which significantly affects the speed of exchange with RAM.
A full-fledged CGA video adapter is installed in the Assistant 86 128. Unlike
the original IBM PC, the "snow" in the Assistant was removed in the 80x25x16
color text mode. The original IBM PC did not have enough video memory speed to
run the processor and monitor at the same time. When the program changed
something on the screen, a noise similar to snow appeared on the screen. The
Assistant 86 128 has a full-fledged XT keyboard with a separate microcontroller
(KR1816BE35). The expansion connector on the computer is non-standard, but if
you wish, you can make an adapter for an ISA board.

My computer has an expansion board containing 1 megabyte of RAM (976 kB
available) and a floppy disk drive controller. Without this board, you will have
to load programs from a tape cassette. By the way, the first IBM PC had such an
opportunity. A program or game found on a floppy disk with friends simply cannot
be recorded on a cassette. It is not obvious how to connect a tape recorder to
a regular IBM PC and where to get programs for recording on a cassette. The game
being recorded should work without MS DOS operating system, on a bare BIOS and
require no more than ~100 KB of RAM. Without a RAM expansion card, the computer
has only 128 kilobytes, some of which uses the BIOS and video adapter. The most
interesting games and programs disappear immediately. But on the other hand,
BASIC is flashed into the ROM of the computer. Without an expansion board
installed, after turning on the computer, we get into BASIC. You can start
writing your program.

When we load MS DOS no program starts due to lack of RAM. MS DOS does not see
extended memory, all ~100 KB of base memory are occupied by the operating system
itself. It is required to reflash the BIOS, which is tightly soldered to the
board. Or download the driver, which fortunately was found on one of the floppy
disks. The ability to create a virtual disk using RAM was built into this
driver. MS DOS cannot use the entire megabyte of memory. The excess is just
convenient to use for a virtual disk. After the operating system is loaded,
system files are copied there, which are constantly loaded from a floppy disk
(command.com, vc.com...). The boot floppy after loading can be removed from the
drive, replacing it, for example, with a game.

MS DOS only supports 5.25" 360 kB floppy disks. If you connect a newer 80-track
drive instead of a 40-track drive to your computer and load the 800.com driver,
then the same 360 ​​kB floppy disks can be formatted on 800 kB. It 800 kB floppies
can be read and write on a big computer.

In general, this is a full-fledged IBM PC, a little faster than the original and
without some of its jambs. It can run all programs for MS DOS / 8086 / CGA. You
can even run Windows 3.0 and older versions.
