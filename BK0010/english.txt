BK0010 is a Soviet school and home computer. Developed by NPO "Scientific
Center‚Äù, now it is Sitronics. This computer uses Soviet 16 bit processor 
KR1801VM1 of their own design. The processor has no foreign analogues, but using
the PDP11 command set, which was developed by DEC corrporation. But this does
not mean that the processor is not Soviet. I'll give you an analogy. AMD
releases processors with an instruction set developed by Intel.

The word PDP11 means not only the processor instruction system, but also
computer architecture that allows you to run operating systems and programs
for PDP11.

BK0010 could not run operating systems and programs from PDP11. Few memory, but
the memory can be increased. The unsolvable problem was the video memory located
in the middle of the address space (at addresses 4000h-7FFFh). The RTOS
operating system (standard for the PDP11) and its programs required contiguous
address space from the beginning of memory. The error is very common. 
ZX Spectrum computer had the same address space problem, no allowing you to run
the CP/M operating system.

The keyboard of the BK0010 is not comfortable, but it is cheap and maintainable.
In it the most common tact buttons (PKN-150) were used, which even now buy is
not a problem. Their only drawback is a very small move. Over button places a
full-size key. And on the keys lies printout. They certainly could put names on
the keys, but the inscriptions on the keys erased by fingers cannot be restored
at home. There are no problems at all to make a new printout and laminate it.

On the right, under the cover, there is a socket for ROM chips. The thing is not
needed and even dangerous, there are enough idiots in schools. The switch under
the cover is a reset. Not a button, but a switch with two positions! To reboot
computer, you need to remove the cover and pull the tiny switch left and right.
I can't understand it. It's easier to turn off and turn on the power supply,
which was external.

The computer had 32 kilobytes of RAM, of which half was used under video memory.
Programs had only 16 kilobytes left. You can work, but still little memory. The
video adapter supported two modes 512x256 2 colors, 256x256 4 colors. There is
hardware vertical scrolling.

In order to reduce the cost, school computers did not solder parts for the
256x256 mode 4 colors. There is a place on the board, but there are no details.

4 colors is not so bad if you could choose any 4 colors from the palette.
But the palette was not added. The computer had 4 fixed colors: black,
red, blue, green. But this was all over the place. IBM PC with CGA adapter
also had two terrible fixed palettes.

In a normal computer, the program itself switches the video adapter mode. If the
program needs 512x256, then it will enable it. If 256x256, then enable it.
BK0010 has two connectors on the back, one for 512x256 resolution, the second
one is for 256x256. If the program is written for 512x256 and TV connected to
256x256 socket, you'll see colored porridge. If the program is written for
256x256 4 colors, and the connector will be in 512, then the color image will
be represented by shading. In this case, colors 1 and 2 will be similar.

The situation is complicated by the fact that the wires had to be soldered by
yourself (from the computer there should be two connectors). Only for this it
was necessary to be able to solder, therefore most of people worked like that.
See screenshot.

BK0010 uses a hardware keyboard controller. The program immediately receives
code of the pressed key. Only now BK0010 cannot process several simultaneously
pressed keys, this problem is hardware and not solvable. And no
auto-repeat when a key is pressed for a long time, this is a software problem.

A lot of games for BK were released and ported. And this despite the fact that
for transfer games had to completely rewrite the entire code.

In schools, computers were networked, where as a central computer DVK computer
was used. DVK contains two six-port network boards (it is more correct to call
the "controller of telegraph channels"). And from each BK was connected a wire
to DVK.

*** Focal ***

The ROM of the BK0010 computer contains the Focal programming language. After
turning on the computer, you could start programming on the Focal. Although all
country taught BASIC.

Focal was the standard language for PDP computers. It was very simple and
small, which allowed to work on the first computers. This language is deciphered
as FORmula CALculator, which actually speaks of its opportunities. From a
programmer's point of view, Focal is very similar to BASIC, but there no string
variables and graphical functions. There are only 26 teams in the BK Focal and
20 functions. Let me briefly talk about it. If not me, then you won't know
never:

Each line of the Focal program has a fractional number, for example "1.10",
"1.20", "5.15". If you enter 1.1, it will mean 1.10.

Commands can be abbreviated to a single letter. All Focal commands beginning
from different letters. And the simplest Focal program looks like this:

// Output the text "Enter a number " and enter the number from the keyboard
// into the variable X
1.10 ASK "Enter number", X

// Evaluate the expression and write the result to Y
1.20 SET Y = X * 2 - 6

// Calculate the value of the expression Y-10, and if it is less than zero,
// then go to line 1.10. If equal to zero, then to line 1.80. If more
// zero, then on line 1.40
1.30 IF(Y-10) 1.10, 1.80, 1.40

// Print the text "Result" and the value of the variable Y
1.40 TYPE "Result", Y

// Print this program
WRITE

// Run this program
GO

That's actually all. Several games were written on the focal point, some even
have become cult. For example "Kingdom of Euphoria".
